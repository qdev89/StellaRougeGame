# Stellar Rogue - Nemesis System

## Overview

The Nemesis System is a unique feature in Stellar Rogue that creates an adaptive final boss that evolves based on your playstyle and previous boss encounters. Each time you defeat a sector boss, the Nemesis studies your tactics and becomes stronger against them, developing resistances to your favorite weapons and adopting attack patterns that counter your preferred build style.

## How It Works

### Learning from Your Victories

Every time you defeat a boss, the Nemesis observes:
- Which weapons you used most frequently
- Your combat style (offensive, defensive, utility, or balanced)
- How quickly you defeated the boss
- Which strategies were most effective

### Adapting to Counter You

Based on this information, the Nemesis will:
- Develop resistances to your most-used weapons
- Adopt attack patterns that counter your preferred build style
- Incorporate visual elements from bosses you've defeated
- Gain new abilities based on your weaknesses

### Morphing During Battle

During the fight, the Nemesis can temporarily morph into forms resembling previously defeated bosses, taking on their characteristics and attack patterns. Recognize these patterns to anticipate its attacks.

## Nemesis Info Screen

Access the Nemesis Info screen from the main menu to see:
- Analysis of your playstyle
- Which bosses you've defeated
- The Nemesis's adaptation to your tactics
- A guide to all Nemesis attack patterns

## Difficulty Settings

You can adjust the Nemesis difficulty in the Nemesis Info screen:
- **Easy**: Longer telegraph times, slower projectiles, reduced damage
- **Normal**: Balanced challenge for most players
- **Hard**: Shorter telegraph times, faster projectiles, increased damage
- **Very Hard**: Minimal telegraph times, fast projectiles, maximum damage
- **Adaptive**: Difficulty adjusts based on your performance

## Rewards

Defeating the Nemesis grants special rewards:
- Unique upgrades based on your playstyle
- Significant credit bonuses
- Special ship unlocks (after multiple defeats)
- Meta-progression bonuses

## Debug Functions

For testing purposes, the following debug functions are available in the browser console:
- `simulateBossDefeats()`: Simulates defeating all bosses with various strategies
- `jumpToNemesisBoss()`: Jumps directly to the Nemesis boss fight
- `showNemesisConfig()`: Displays the current Nemesis configuration
- `resetNemesisSystem()`: Resets all Nemesis data

You can also use the test page `test-nemesis-system.html` to verify the Nemesis System functionality.

## Tips for Facing the Nemesis

1. **Vary your weapons**: Don't rely too heavily on a single weapon type
2. **Balance your build**: Mix offensive, defensive, and utility upgrades
3. **Study the patterns**: Each form has recognizable attack patterns
4. **Watch for telegraphs**: Most attacks have visual warnings
5. **Adapt your strategy**: If one approach isn't working, try something different

Good luck, pilot! The Nemesis awaits...
