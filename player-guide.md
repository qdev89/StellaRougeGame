- **Shields**: Absorbs damage before your hull takes hits. Regenerates slowly over time.
- **Weapons**: Your offensive capabilities. Different weapons have different properties.
- **Ammo**: Required for most weapons (except the basic laser). Collect from defeated enemies.
- **Subsystems**: Special modules that can be upgraded and arranged in the Synergy Grid.

### Weapons

1. **Basic Laser**: Unlimited ammo, rapid fire, moderate damage.
2. **Tri-Beam**: Fires three projectiles in a spread pattern.
3. **Plasma Bolt**: High damage, slower fire rate.
4. **Homing Missile**: Tracks enemies, good for fast-moving targets.
5. **Dual Cannon**: Balanced damage and fire rate.
6. **Beam Laser**: Continuous damage beam, drains ammo quickly.

## Progression

### Sector Structure

The game is divided into sectors, each with increasing difficulty:

1. Each sector contains multiple nodes connected by paths.
2. Nodes can be combat encounters, elite enemies, shops, or special events.
3. At the end of each sector is a boss encounter.
4. Defeating the boss allows you to proceed to the next sector.

### Upgrades and Penalties

Throughout your journey, you'll encounter upgrades and penalties:

- **Upgrades**: Enhance your ship's capabilities. Collect from defeated bosses, special encounters, and shops.
- **Penalties**: Negative effects that make your journey more challenging. Often paired with powerful upgrades as a trade-off.

### Subsystem Synergy Grid

The Synergy Grid is a 3Ã—3 grid where you can place subsystem upgrades:

- Compatible upgrades placed adjacent to each other create powerful synergy effects.
- Experiment with different arrangements to find optimal combinations.
- Access the grid from the ship status screen.

### Meta-Progression

Between runs, you'll earn credits that can be spent on permanent upgrades:

- **Ship Unlocks**: New ship types with different starting stats and abilities.
- **Permanent Upgrades**: Enhancements that apply to all future runs.
- **Starting Equipment**: Better gear to begin your journey with.

### Bosses

Each sector ends with a unique boss encounter:

1. **The Guardian** (Sector 1): Heavily armored defensive ship with shield generators.
2. **Battle Carrier** (Sector 2): Massive carrier that deploys waves of drones.
3. **Destroyer Prime** (Sector 3): Heavily armed battleship with devastating artillery.
4. **Stealth Overlord** (Sector 4): Master of stealth technology that phases in and out of visibility.
5. **Dreadnought** (Sector 5): Flagship with multiple weapon systems.

### The Nemesis

The final boss adapts based on how you defeated previous bosses:

- Studies your playstyle and counters your preferred strategies
- Incorporates elements from previously defeated bosses
- Changes tactics as the battle progresses
- Requires adaptability to overcome

## Tips for Success

1. **Manage Your Ammo**: Don't waste shots. The basic laser has unlimited ammo but lower damage.
2. **Prioritize Targets**: Eliminate the most dangerous enemies first.
3. **Use Cover**: Asteroids and debris can block enemy projectiles.
4. **Balance Risk and Reward**: Sometimes the safer path is better than the potentially more rewarding one.
5. **Learn Boss Patterns**: Each boss has specific attack patterns. Observe and adapt.
6. **Synergize Upgrades**: Place compatible upgrades adjacent to each other in the Synergy Grid.
7. **Adapt Your Weapons**: Different situations call for different weapons.
8. **Watch Your Health**: If your hull integrity gets low, play more defensively.
9. **Use Screen Space**: The entire screen is your battlefield. Don't stay in one place.
10. **Learn from Defeat**: Each run teaches you something new. Use that knowledge in future attempts.

- **Performance Problems**: Lower the particle quality in the options menu.
