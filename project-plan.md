# STELLAR ROGUE - Project Plan

## Game Overview

**STELLAR ROGUE** is a vertical scrolling retro roguelike flying shooter built with HTML5/JavaScript using the Phaser.js framework. Players pilot a fighter craft through procedurally generated sectors filled with enemies, hazards, and encounters, making meaningful choices that affect their ship's capabilities and the challenges ahead.

The game features a balanced difficulty level with 50% fewer enemies and reduced ammo frequency, making it accessible while still providing a challenge.

## Core Game Elements

### 1. Retro Visual Style
- 16-bit pixel art aesthetic reminiscent of SNES-era shooters
- Vibrant colors with detailed sprite work
- Enhanced spaceship sprite with realistic thruster effects and lighting
- Improved UI with better visibility for health and shield bars
- Smooth animations and particle effects

### 2. Roguelike Elements
- **Run-based Progression**: Each mission is a separate attempt with permadeath
- **Procedural Generation**: Dynamically generated sectors, enemy formations, and hazards
- **Meta-progression**: Persistent unlocks between runs
- **Player Choice**: Meaningful decisions that shape each run

### 3. Core Choice & Consequence System
- **Decision Points**: Choices after clearing sectors, at upgrade stations, and during emergencies
- **Rewards**: Weapon modifications, ship systems, specialized equipment, passive abilities
- **Penalties/Tradeoffs**: Subsystem damage, vulnerabilities, enemy adaptations, resource drains
- **Synergies**: Compatible upgrades create powerful combinations when installed in adjacent subsystem slots

### 4. Unique Features
- **Subsystem Synergy Grid**: A 3×3 grid of ship subsystems that create powerful effects when compatible upgrades are adjacent
- **Nemesis System**: The final boss evolves based on how you defeated previous sector bosses
