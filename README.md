## Game Overview

**STELLAR ROGUE** is a roguelike vertical scrolling shooter where players pilot a fighter craft through procedurally generated sectors filled with enemies, hazards, and encounters. Navigate through dangerous space sectors, defeat unique mini-bosses, and face off against powerful sector bosses in specially designed arena battles.

The game features a balanced difficulty level with 50% fewer enemies and a strategic ammo management system with reduced ammo frequency. This makes the game more accessible while still providing a challenge. Players must collect ammo drops from defeated enemies and manage their weapon resources while battling through each sector.

Make meaningful choices that affect your ship's capabilities and the challenges ahead. Collect upgrades from defeated bosses, manage your ship's systems, and prepare for the ultimate confrontation with the adaptive Nemesis boss that evolves based on your playstyle.
