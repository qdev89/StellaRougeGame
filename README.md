## Game Overview

**STELLA ROUGE** is a roguelike vertical scrolling shooter where players pilot a variety of spacecraft through procedurally generated sectors filled with enemies, hazards, and encounters. Choose from multiple ship types with unique abilities - from the agile Scout to the heavily armored Juggernaut, the resourceful Technician, or the high-risk Prototype X. Navigate through dangerous space sectors, defeat unique mini-bosses, and face off against powerful sector bosses in specially designed arena battles.

The game features a balanced difficulty level with 50% fewer enemies and a strategic ammo management system with reduced ammo frequency. This makes the game more accessible while still providing a challenge. Players must collect ammo drops from defeated enemies and manage their weapon resources while battling through each sector.

Make meaningful choices that affect your ship's capabilities and the challenges ahead. Collect upgrades from defeated bosses, manage your ship's systems, and prepare for the ultimate confrontation with the adaptive Nemesis boss that evolves based on your playstyle. Unlock achievements to earn rewards and customize your ship's appearance with different color schemes, engine effects, decorations, and weapon skins.
