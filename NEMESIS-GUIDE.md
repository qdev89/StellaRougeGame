# The Nemesis System - Player Guide

## What is the Nemesis?

The Nemesis is the ultimate challenge in Stellar Rogue - a final boss that learns from your previous encounters and adapts to counter your preferred strategies. Each time you defeat a boss, the Nemesis studies your tactics and becomes stronger against them.

## How the Nemesis Works

### It Learns From Your Victories

Every time you defeat a boss, the Nemesis observes:
- Which weapons you used most frequently
- Your combat style (offensive, defensive, utility, or balanced)
- How quickly you defeated the boss
- Which strategies were most effective

### It Adapts to Counter You

The Nemesis uses this knowledge to:
- Develop resistances to your favorite weapons
- Adopt attack patterns that counter your preferred build style
- Incorporate abilities from bosses you've already defeated
- Change tactics during battle based on your actions

### It Evolves With Each Encounter

The more bosses you defeat, the stronger and more adaptive the Nemesis becomes:
- It gains new abilities from each defeated boss
- Its appearance changes to reflect the bosses you've faced
- It develops more complex phase transitions
- It can morph between different boss forms during battle

## Facing the Nemesis

### When Will You Encounter It?

The Nemesis appears as the final boss in Sector 10. By this point, it will have studied your tactics from previous boss encounters and will be fully prepared to counter your strategies.

### Tips for Victory

1. **Diversify Your Arsenal**: Don't rely too heavily on a single weapon type. The Nemesis will develop resistances to your most-used weapons.

2. **Be Adaptable**: The Nemesis will change tactics during the fight. Be prepared to switch your approach when it morphs or enters a new phase.

3. **Study Its Patterns**: The Nemesis will telegraph which previous boss form it's currently mimicking. Recognize these patterns to anticipate its attacks.

4. **Balance Your Build**: A well-rounded ship with a mix of offensive, defensive, and utility upgrades will be more effective against the Nemesis than a highly specialized build.

5. **Watch for Weaknesses**: Even the Nemesis has vulnerabilities. Look for opportunities when it's changing forms or transitioning between phases.

## The Lore of the Nemesis

The Nemesis is not just another enemy - it's an entity that has been observing your journey through the stars. Some say it's an advanced AI that analyzes combat data from all encounters. Others believe it's a shapeshifting entity that absorbs the essence of defeated foes.

Whatever its true nature, the Nemesis represents the culmination of your journey - a final test that adapts to challenge even the most skilled pilots based on their own unique style of combat.

Defeat the Nemesis, and you'll prove that you can overcome not just any enemy, but an enemy specifically designed to counter your greatest strengths.
